## Weebo Java Flow Chart Visualizer
APCS1 Final Project
## Description
Welcome to the Weebo Java Flow Chart Visualizer!

This program will help visualize 
any for loops within
your .java file. This program doesn't accomodate
for nested for loops yet. If you have a nested
loop, the program will detect it but not visualize it
correctly.

If you would like to read in a file, copy the file
into this cloned github repo.
The file will not be read if it is not within this repo.
**Please make sure that your .java file does not have
any syntax errors as the visualizer will not be able
to run properly with syntax errors.** Run `$ javac filename.java`
to find any syntax errors your code may have.

If you would like to view a model example of
the Java Visualizer, type in Moo.java when the
program prompts you for a file to read in. 
`File to read in: **type in file here**`

## Launch
1. Compile Woo.java `$javac Woo.java`
2. Run Woo `$java Woo`
