## Weebo Java Flow Chart Visualizer
APCS1 Final Project
## Description
Welcome to the Weebo Java Flow Chart Visualizer

Currently this program will only output the
for loop parameters of any for loops within
your .java file. This program doesn't accomodate
for nested for loops yet.

If you would like to read in a file, copy the file
into this cloned github repo.
The file will not be read if it is not within this repo.

If you would like to view a model example of
the Java Visualizer, type in Moo.java when the
program prompts you for a file to read in. 
`File to read in: **type in file here**`
## Launch

1. Compile Woo.java `$javac Woo.java`
2. Run Woo `$java Woo`
